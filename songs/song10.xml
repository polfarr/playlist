	[Verse 1: 2-D]
I met the princess from Thailand again
She had grown up into a queen
Down in the abyss where the night
Never turns to daylight
She kept me in a Polaroid
That was pinned up on her wall
Under Garuda's mirror lights
She takes flight, yeah, the kid's alright

[Chorus: 2-D]
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen (You've grown up)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
She fell into the generals (Oh, Baby Queen)
On the watch all around her
I fell into the vanity
The mirrored lights of our dreams

[Chorus: 2-D]
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Wherе you've been (Dream, dream, drеam, dream)
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Where you've been (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Where you've been (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Where you've been (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Where you've been (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
You've grown up
Oh, Baby Queen
In my dreams (Dream, dream, dream, dream)
Where you've been (Baby Queen; dream, dream, dream, dream)
