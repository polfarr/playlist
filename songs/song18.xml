		[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, mother
I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine
No, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train
Just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain
Just by the side of the Tin Man

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, brother
I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine
No, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train
Just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain
Just by the side of the Tin Man

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I keep coming up short
See Imagine Dragons Live
Get tickets as low as $76

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry, lover
I'm sorry, I bring you down
Well, these days I try
And these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery
And then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically
"Congratulations, you are all alone"

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried

[Bridge]
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried


[Outro]
But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls they're crashin' down
No, I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls they're crashin' down
And I keep coming up short
