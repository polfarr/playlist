	[Chorus: Kevin Parker]
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Moved to the spot, I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything, but nothin' to do
Tilted in a Tesla, partner, ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, they on the Xannies
Liposuction schedulеd for Granny
She want to save some, add to hеr fanny
Girls' trip, Miami at the end of the year
Polluted-filled skies, tryin' to think clear
I heard the bad news while I was sheddin' a beer
Watch out from the coast, Paul Revere
We all play a part in the devil's cheer
Run to the hills 'cause the end is near

[Chorus: Kevin Parker]
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder

[Verse 2: Bootie Brown]
Yo, a desolate city where it hurts to smile
Ran into the Reverend, says it's been a while
I'm reining in a rando', she's a social scandal
Gave ourselves a handout when it's too much to bear
ABC boys raided the mayor
Like Shaun, he's a Ryder, took on the dare
Now he's singin' like a birdy, pullin' on his hair
Trendin' on Twitter's what some of us live for
Friendship's here, but now fuckin' revolving door
All of this a joke? Pauly Shore
Bullshit keeps comin', maybe I'm a matador
What are we livin' for?

[Break: Bootie Brown, Kevin Parker & Both]
Are we all losin' our minds?
Because life got in the way (Hey, hey, hey)
They will be here just in time
Your replacement is here to stay (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge: 2-D, Bootie Brown & Kevin Parker]
New gold, fool's gold
Everythin' will disappear (New gold)
Someone's out here
Who traveled far too many years (New gold)
To nowhere, nowhere
Nothin' here is ever real (New gold)
New gold, fool's gold (New gold)
Everythin' will disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear
Disappear, disappear, disappear


[Chorus: Kevin Parker & 2-D]
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one (New gold)
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(New gold, fool's gold)
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
(Everythin' will disappear)
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want (New gold)
(Someone's out here)
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
(Who traveled far too many years)
That's the way it goes in this city wonder (New gold)
(To nowhere, nowhere)
But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
(Nothin' here is ever real)
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want (New gold)
(New gold, fool's gold)
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater (New gold)
(Everythin' will disappear)
That's the way it goes in this city wonder
