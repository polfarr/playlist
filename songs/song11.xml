	[Intro: 2-D]
To the pole and he's tried to let it go
But nobody knows what they're fooling with here

[Verse 1: 2-D]
There will be time and there will be a sign (Ape)
When all the kids who have cancelled time will (Ape)
Take my hands and pull me up again (Ape)
Cheer me up and help me walk again (Walk again, walk again)

[Refrain: 2-D]
To the pole and he's tried to let it go
But nobody knows what they're fooling with here (Ape)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I got bones and I got jaded legs (Ape)
Not the type that can win a race (Ape)
Live in plastic on a vacant lot (Ape)
Left behind, staring at a robot

[Chorus: 2-D]
Don't be sad for me (Ape)
I'm a cartoon G (Ape)
And my intent is to breathe (Ape)
In a new world, don't be sad for me
See Gorillaz Live
Get tickets as low as $197

[Interlude: 2-D]
(Ape)
Breathe
(Ape)

[Verse 3: 2-D]
I can balance on the highest tree (Ape)
You can only see outlines of me (Ape)
I can disappear or lighten your day (Ape)
Imitate and say, "I'm a skinny little ape"

[Chorus: 2-D]
Don't be sad for me (I'm a skinny little ape; ape)
I'm a cartoon G (I'm a cartoon G; ape)
And my intent is to breathe (Ape)
In a new world, don't be sad for me

[Chorus: 2-D]
Don't be sad for me (Know there is a heaven, I think I'm gonna fly)
I'm a cartoon G (But now I'm in the plastic and staring at the sky)
And my intent is to breathe (Ape)
In a new world, don't be sad for me

[Breakdown: 2-D]
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape (Ape)
I'm a skinny little, skinny little, skinny little, skinny little
Ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape, ape


[Outro: 2-D]
But nobody knows what they're fooling with here
(Don't be sad for me)
