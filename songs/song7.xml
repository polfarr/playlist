	[Verse 1: 2D]
I think the sadness has come again
Green velvet in a parked sedan
Nobody missed her gold earring
Right aside for you
Nothing will be bad for me then to
I just wanna put my arms round you
And whisper, I'm on one percent but I'm there with you

[Chorus: 2D]
I know I fantasize
Although I don't even find
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

[Verse 2: 2D]
Through all of my tunes, I'll dance tonight
With you frozen under mirrored lights
Way's out, only weighs in to my heart
As the colors explode again
It's a problem that I can't repair
Always with you, always

[Chorus: 2D]
I know I fantasize
Although I don't even find
If you'rе good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

[Bridge: 2D]
Timе's run out (In my life)
Nowhere real (In my life)
In the hills (In my life)
Is what I feel (All my life, on my own, on my own)
On my own
Time run out
I need you

[Chorus: 2D]
Weighs in to my heart
I need you, I need you, I need you
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life
I know I fantasize
Although I don't even find
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

[Outro: 2D]
Times run out (In my life)
Nowhere real (In my life)
In the hills (In my life)
Is what I feel (In my life, in my life, in my life)
On my own
Time run out
If you're good for me, then I'm good for you, then that's all I need in my life (I need you)
