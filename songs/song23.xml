[Verse 1]
Early mornin', take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top, oh-oh, oh-oh
Early mornin', wake me up
Father, father, father
This is not enough, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey

[Post-Chorus]
The underdog, hey
The underdog, hey

[Verse 2]
Early evenin', settle down
Father, father, father
Who am I to blame, oh-oh, oh-oh
Early evenin', hush me over
Father, father, father
Are we just the same, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
