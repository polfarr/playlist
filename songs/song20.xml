[Intro]
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

[Verse 1]
I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your hair
That ruffles you up

[Pre-Chorus]
If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

[Post-Chorus]
My mind is made up
Nothing can change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
See Imagine Dragons Live

[Verse 2]
Searching to find myself
But all I find is you
I can hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

[Post-Chorus]
My mind is made up
Nothing can change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

[Bridge]
No matter, no matter, no matter what we're facing
It don't matter, don't matter
'Cause the reason that I'm here
Is the same through all these years
Not changing, not changing anything at all


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night, every night, every night, every night

[Post-Chorus]
My mind is made up
Nothing can change that
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night, every night, every night, every night
