		[Verse 1]
In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye, but I've never wondered why

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

[Verse 2]
From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I've never had to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep
See Imagine Dragons Live
Get tickets as low as $76

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

[Bridge]
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
