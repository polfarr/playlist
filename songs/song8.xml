	[Verse 1: 2-D]
Stop 'cause you're killin' me
You brought me back and made me feel free
Rowdy waves and your energy
You pulled me fragile from the wreckage
Well, I got so lost here
Machine-assisted, I disappeared
Into a dream, you don't wanna hear
How I got caught up in nowhere again (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: 2-D]
It feels like I've been silent runnin' (Silent runnin')
Through the infinite pages, I scroll out
Searchin' for a new world
That waits on the sunrise
I'm silent runnin'

[Post-Chorus: 2-D, Adeleye Omotayo]
Run, run, runnin' (Oh)
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin' (I'll be)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
I'm silent runnin'

[Verse 2: 2-D, Adeleye Omotayo]
Stop or you'll make me cry (Makе me cry)
I think it's time that I decidе (I decide)
What I've done when I trip and fly (Trip and fly)
And where it's takin' me (Takin' me)
There's no way out of here (No way out)
In the labyrinth, I disappear (No one here)
To the dark fleets that got me here (Underground)
I got caught up in nowhere again

[Chorus: 2-D, Adeleye Omotayo]
It feels like I've been silent runnin' (Silent runnin')
Through the infinite pages, I scroll out
Searchin' for a new world (Trip and fly)
Waits on the sunrise
I'm silent runnin'

[Chorus: 2-D, Adeleye Omotayo]
I'm silent runnin'
(No way out)
I'll be (Ah)
Back to you (Trip and fly), back to you, back to you
I'm silent runnin'

[Post-Chorus: 2-D, Adeleye Omotayo]
Run, run, runnin' (Oh)
Run, run, runnin' (I been, yeah)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
Run, run, runnin' (I'll be)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)
Run, run, runnin' (Back to you)


[Outro: Adeleye Omotayo, 2-D]
Oh, make me cry (Memories of triumph)
I decide (This is the season of madness)
Trip and fly (Trip and fly)
Takin'
