	[Verse 1: 2D]
I stand and look out on the dark lake
Where the moon is rising
And the hydrofoils are coming back in
From the past in silence

[Chorus: 2D]
Where things, they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end

[Verse 2: 2D & Beck]
Where the pearly gates remain open
And welcome me home
'Cause the time I came to California, I died
At the hands of the ghosting queen

[Chorus: 2D & Beck]
Where things, they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end
Evermore

[Bridge: 2D, Beck, and Both]
Should I ask you (Should I ask you) for forgiveness (Forgiveness) and open my heart?
If I say these words, will you listen or leave me here in the dark?

[Chorus: 2D & Beck]
Where things, they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end

[Chorus: 2D & Beck]
Where things, they don't exist
