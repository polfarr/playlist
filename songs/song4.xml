		[Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
People pleasin' planet
Got a million people sayin' how to plan it
I can no longer stand it
Gonna spend my days tellin' them to can it
Each and to their own
Got a salesman ringin' my phone
Tell me where to go
No, I don't wanna hear the down low

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I owe, oh-oh-oh
Nothin', not a penny, never wanna hear you preach
No, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Take-take-take-take, take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have thе mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach
See Imagine Dragons Live

[Verse 2: Ado]
Ah, 聞く耳断つ
奴が大層な胸を張る
また構わずやる
「望まない」から舌を打つ
(チッ) え？Ah
神か仏か？ヒト気取りか？
頭の中 lеave me alone
誰になればいいの？
Take your hands off

[Pre-Chorus: Ado]
I owe, oh-oh-oh
吐き出す前に口をとじろ
No, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds, Dan Reynolds & Ado]
Take-take-take-take, take me to the beach
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold
My heart is cold enough
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach


[Bridge: Dan Reynolds, Ado, Dan Reynolds & Ado]
I'm better off alone (Better off alone)
Like a rollin' stone (Like a rollin' stone)
Turnin' off my phone (Off my phone)
No one bringin' me down, down, down, down
Just give me some space (Just give me some space)
That sun in my face (Sun in my face)
And the days go on, and on, and on, and on
(T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds, Dan Reynolds & Ado]
T-A-K-E, take me to the beach (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains (Have the mountains)
Ah-ah-ah, you take the snow
Ah-ah-ah, it's way too cold (It's way too cold)
My heart is cold enough (Oh)
Ah-ah-ah, push comes to shove
Ah-ah-ah, you could have the mountains
Ah-ah-ah, I'll take the beach (I'll take the)
(I'll take the) Take me to the

[Outro: Dan Reynolds, Ado, Dan Reynolds & Ado]
I don't have no friends, そう何も, ayy
Got me 'til the end, 最後まで, ayy (Take me to the beach; don't, I'll take the)
I don't have no friends, そう誰も, ayy (Ask anyone)
Got me 'til the end, 最後まで
Take me to the beach
