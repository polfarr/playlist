		[Verse 1]
Wheels up when I'm off the ground, I'm
Nowhere, but I'm all around
I'm spinnin-in-in', watch me now, I'm
Spinnin-in-in' (Spinnin-in-in')
Big man when a wall between us
Big man gonna break to pieces
Spinnin-in-in', can't believe it
Spinnin-in-in' (Spinnin-in-in')

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, turn around, turn it up
Talk a bit, zip it up
Lock you in, and close it up
Yup

[Chorus]
Everybody's comin' for you, wake up
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up
Everybody's comin', wake up

[Verse 2]
Some days, I'm a cha-chameleon
Switch it up when I crawl the ceilin'
Flip it upside down, I'm wheelin'
Dealin-in-in' (Dealin-in-in')
Every single one of you is comin' to my mind
Bring 'em all together, can you stack 'em in a line?
Jealousy is gonna be your failure, not mine
Winnin-in-in' (Winnin-in-in')

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, turn around, turn it up
Talk a bit, zip it up
Lock you in, and close it up (Up, up, up, up)
Oh!

[Chorus]
Everybody's comin' for you, wake up (Wake up)
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)
Everybody's comin', wake up

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody's comin', wake up

[Bridge]
Got a case of the take-or-leave-it
Give an inch and I'm bound to seize it
Take a chainsaw out and feed it
Ring-dingin-in-in' (Ring-dingin-in-in')
Come alive when you don't believe it
Write me off, and I'd love to read it
Spit your words, and I'll watch you eat it
Diggin-in-in' (Diggin-in-in')
Oh!


[Chorus]
Everybody's coming for you, wake up (Wake up)
Everybody's comin', wake up
Bodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)
Everybody's comin', wake up

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody's comin', wake up

[Outro]
What are you to do?
When they come for you
Winners hate to lose
